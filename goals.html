	<h1>Goals</h1>
		<p>After working in the restaurant/foodservice industry for over a decade, I am attending gSchool to transition my career into a new industry that is more in line with my strengths and values. I am fascinated by the ability to create value, entertain and inform with nothing more than a computer and some programming knowledge. After graduation, I hope to find a job with an innovative company where I can help build cool stuff and continue to learn.</p>
