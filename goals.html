	<h1>Goals</h1>
	<p>I am excited to start gSchool and learn the skills necessary to transition my career into a new role in a new industry. I am fascinated by the potential to create value, entertain and inform with nothing more than a computer and a few lines of code. I'm not sure what kind of company I hope to join upon graduation, but I hope to find an interesting and challenging role where I can make a difference.</p>
