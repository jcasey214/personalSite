	<h1>Goals</h1>
		<p>After working in the restaurant/foodservice industry for over a decade, I am attending gSchool to transition my career into a new industry that is more in-line with my strengths and values. I've always been fascinated by the ability to create value, entertain and inform with nothing more than a computer and a few lines of code. After graduation, I hope to find a job with an innovative company where I can help build cool stuff.</p>
